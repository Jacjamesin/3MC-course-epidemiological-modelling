# PDF Slides

These are the `pdf` slides for the different components of the course. Note that they are, at the time of writing, work in progress. They contain typos and are not even complete. I will indicate here when the material for a given lecture is closer to being ready.

The pdf files are provided for convenience as all figures are embedded and therefore only one download is needed. Note, however, that neither movies nor embedded Shiny scripts will function in the `pdf` version.
