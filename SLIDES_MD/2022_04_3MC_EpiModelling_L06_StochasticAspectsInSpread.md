# Why stochastic systems? And what type?

# Why stochastic systems?

Life results from the interaction of countless processes

Each process happens with some degree of imprecision. E.g., when a virus replicates, it misses a base here and there; when a cell undergoes mitosis, material is not split 50-50; when you meet another human, you *forget* to shake their hand. Etc.

Because of repetition, this gives rise to uncertainty

Stochastic systems incorporate uncertainty
